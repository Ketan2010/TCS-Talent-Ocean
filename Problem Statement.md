# Introduction of TCS Talent Ocean 2020:
Algorithms have penetrated deeply into our everyday lives. They help us with product recommendations, fastest route to our destinations, correcting our spelling mistake, possible responses to an e-mail, identifying and tagging our friends etc. The possibilities are endless.

This hackathon is a step further in that direction to enable algorithmic matching between a candidate skill and a project profile. Participants will be given sample skills and project profiles that were matched for training the algorithm and they will be required to match skill to profile on the test data. Participants are free to choose any programming language of their choice for implementing the solution.

# Contest Overview of TCS Talent Ocean :
The contest is a single member event and will have two rounds

Round 1 - Submitting the solution - CSV file with details of students matched to the project opportunities
