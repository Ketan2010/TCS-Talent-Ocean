p7,Chennai,PHYGITAL,UI/UX Designing skills,"<p>The financial services and insurance industry is going thru a paradigm shift in differentiating their products and services using next gen interaction platforms. Primary among them is the use of conversational platforms powered by industry leading providers like Amazon Alexa etc. While there are many PoC and pilot implementation done in many other areas, the needs in the financial services and insurance are more functionally and regulation driven. Hence, platforms like Alexa need to be trained with more contextual data. These also need to be have capabilities around NLP, AI on the one hand and human-centric elements like tone, emotions etc. This assignment would involve &quot;training&quot; the conversation platforms by providing many logical and more human centric speech/voice based inputs and validate the responses of these conversational platforms.

p11,Chennai,PHYGITAL,"Java/Python,ReactJS,MongoDB,exposure to Machine Learning concepts and algorithms","<p>Banks and Financial Instituitions employ traditional credit scoring models to decide if a loan could be offered to applicants. These models look at historical repayment of credits, requiring the applicants to hold considerable credit history. Due to this, the start-up companies and those without a credit history find it extremely difficult to obtain a loan. With FinTechs using alternate lending models for scoring, banks are losing out significant revenue. It is imperative for banks and large financial instituitions to build alternate credit scoring models that factor in alternate data (such as bill payments, rent payments, recharge patterns). This project aims to build such models that leverage the power of data and artificial intelligence, which can be used by financial instituitions, for offering hyper-personalized credit products to the seeker.

Market leaders are looking for 100 % straight-through processing i.e. all trades should be executed, confirmed, and settled with no involvement by middle office or back-office staff. However, for a number of business reasons, trades fail and hence need Middle-office staff to perform exception processing by identifying the reason for the rejection and fix the trade. All these manual steps needs time and resources, which in turn lead to increased cost per trade. Artificial Intelligence techniques can analyse available past data to know the reasons for Trade settlement failure on time with suggested steps to fix that. Artificial Intelligence through pattern recognition analysis can predict probable trades which might fail and can also suggest the likely solutions. Machine learning algorithms can help in evolving this logic through repetitive analysis, resulting in far more efficient settlement process.

For example, lets consider a vehicle being driven at 40 mph and the driver needs to adjust the volume of the radio, or even change the channel, which might take the driver&rsquo;s eyes away for about 1.2 seconds. A car traveling at that speed will cover more than 20 meters in 1.2 seconds, opening possible corridors for a mishap just waiting to happen. Controlling multiple devices while driving steals drivers&#39; attention from the road and is becoming the cause of accidents in 1 out of 3 cases. So, to counter this issue, Touch-less automotive gesture-recognition technology could come into play here, whereby a driver can swiftly adjust any settings with the help of certain standard hand gestures.

p165,Hyderabad,PHYGITAL,Machine learning basics,"<p>Machine Learning algorithms are being rapidly employed in various industries to minimize human efforts in identifying a problem as well so to arrive at predictions/decisions for business implications. As rightly stated by many Machine Learning Experts, a best algorithm is deemed to be efficient only when we have the right data. Machine Learning bias is identified when an algorithm produces erroneous outputs due to many reasons; one of the prime reason being biased data used for training the model. So understanding and structuring the data before training is important so as the ensure that the bias is neither reflected nor intensified in the predictions made. Thus monitoring and auditing the model with real-time data is also crucial to determine any discriminating patterns in prediction and further to mark a model fair or not. UseCase: Driver drowsiness detection. A potential reason that a person driving a vehicle involves in an accident or encounter a collision is when he is drowsy. So identified the drowsiness and alerting or warning him at the earliest stage will help him to curb such situations. Possible bias: Dataset with: Only particular age group of people, People without spectacles People of a particular geographical location.</p>

p259,Bangalore,PHYGITAL,Good Programming Skills,"<p>Occupational fraud is a global issue. On average, a company loses 5% of its revenues to employee financial fraud each year, with the annual median loss at $140,000 and over 20% of companies reporting losses of $1 million or more. The key to keeping a lid on this fraud is identifying the fraud before it takes too much of a bite out of the company&rsquo;s bottom line, or even further, to put processes and controls in place that automatically audits, monitors, and accepts or rejects transactions that don&rsquo;t fit an recognized pattern. The emerging areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can help companies by acting as automated, intelligent virtual assistants, providing the sort of capabilities that would otherwise require a significant amount of human power. Our aim is to create a product/tool with ML in the backend to predict financial claims submitted by the employee.</p>

p265,Kolkata,DIGITAL,Good Programming Skills,"<p>Context: Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales are biggest revenue earning events for retailers and best deals/discounts are provided this time. So everybody loves the deals but unfortunately single item can be available from different merchants at different price.Its not always easy to find the available deal easily. Also price of an item can change frequently during this period. Most of the retailers provide price match which means one retailer will sell a particular item at a lower price advertised by competitor if the customer is able to show proof of lower price. Similarly, if price of an item drops within few weeks after purchase some credit card provider banks or the merchant it self can refund the difference of price. Goal: So the goal of the project is to build an industry standard solution, which will enable buyers to : 1.Find the best deal for an item among the offers by most reputed retailers from a single place. 2.Track price of an item selected by user from different merchants and notify them of a price drop alert, so that they can take advantage of price match/drop policy 3. Users can add an item an to watch list, system will track the price of an item from different merchants and provide visual trend based on historical data.This will enable buyers to pind down the best time to buy an item 4.Users can choose to unsubscribe from the alert when no longer needed. Basic requirements: 1.Pre-requisite should be to get development api key from major retailers like Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart, Target etc which are publicly available and documented. 2. Different api responses will have different structures and identifiers.To verify that different products from different merchants are same we should rely on the UPC code if its available. 3.For historical data, different api responses should be converted to uniform structure and stored in own database provided retailer&#39;s api policy permits that. 4.System should distinguish between new, used , refurbished products in API responses and concentrate only on new products. 5.System should distinguish between marketplace items and items sold by merchants based on respective API documentation. 6.Historical visualization can be made of lowest and highest price of each day. 7.For notification on user created watchlist, priced needs to be checked atleast on hourly basis. 8.Notifications can be in the form of email or text.</p>

p533,Mumbai,DIGITAL,"creating Apps,Exposure to AI/NLP in coursework","<p>Large organizations spend millions of dollars every year sponsoring marketing events of all shapes and sizes, working to lure customers to consume their thought leadership and IP, and most important for customers to meeting with them for meaningful engagement to identify, advance, or close business opportunities. Unfortunately drawing clear lines of real impact of these investments to opportunity or revenue influence is very difficult. And ability to ensure what impact does happen requires ensuring the objectives for those meetings are clear, and that the right people and thinking are involved. This project is rethinking how these event-based meetings are planned, executed, and ultimately creating clear traceability to opportunity and revenue impact. Moreover it means leveraging technology available to us to go exponential with meeting planning, execution, and driving outcomes &ndash; e.g. AI to recommend meeting participants based on agendas, next best action to drive meaningful outcomes, and transparency and collaboration for meeting scheduling and planning. Use AI to predict costs based on cost-benefit analysis of previous events and adaptation to current geography. This project requires statistical understanding of data and various industry problems. Training will be imparted on industry model for statistical data inferences for faster decision making, as well as event-based marketing and campaigns.</p>
